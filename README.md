# handwritten-text-recognition
In this test, I implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) to recognize a sequence of handwritten characters. Unlike the conventional optical character recognition (OCR) approaches, in which each character is recognized separately, requiring therefore a previous step where  the characters are partitioned, with RNN we can retrieve the sequence of characters without explicitly partitioning into character units.
